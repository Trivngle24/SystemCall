Array Statistics Sys-Call
• First, you'll add a new system call that computes some basic statistics on an array
of data. In practice it makes little sense to have this as a sys-call; however, it
allows us to become familiar with accessing memory between user and kernel
space before accessing other kernel data structures.
Requirements
• In the kernel's cs300/ folder, create a file named array_stats.h with the
contents:
// Define the array_stats struct for the array_stats sys-call.
• #ifndef _ARRAY_STATS_H_
• #define _ARRAY_STATS_H_
•
• struct array_stats{
• long min;
• long max;
• long sum;
• };
•
• #endif
• Create a new sys-call named array_stats (function sys_array_stats() ):
• Implement it in your kernel's cs300/ folder in a file name
array_stats.c. Use
#include "array_stats.h"
• Make its sys-call number 331 (in syscall_64.tbl).
• The sys-call's prototype is:
asmlinkage long sys_array_stats(
struct array_stats *stats,
long data[],
long size);
• stats: A pointer to one array_stats structure allocated
by the user-space application. Structure will be written to
by the sys-call to store the minimum, maximum, and sum
of all values in the array pointed to by data.
• data: An array of long int values passed in by the userspace
application.
• size: The number of elements in data. Must be > 0.
• The array_stats sys-call must:
• Set the three fields of the stats structure based on the data array.
The values in data are signed (positive or negative). Nothing
special need be done if the sum of all the data overflows/
underflows a long.
• Return 0 when successful.
• Returns -EINVAL if size <= 0.
• Returns -EFAULT if any problems access stats or data.
• You must not allocate or use a large amount of kernel memory to
copy the entire input data array into.
Hints
• Use printk() calls in the kernel to print out debug information. You may
leave some of these printk() messages in your solution as these
messages are not technically displayed by the user-space application. The
messages you leave in should be helpful such as showing parameters
values or errors it caught; they should not be of the sort “running line 17”,
or “past loop 1”...
• Hint: printk() the parameters you are given, and printk() any 
error conditions you handle.
• Hint: Add extra printk() messages to help debug where things
are going wrong. Remember to remove these unneeded messages
before submission.
• Correct memory access is the hardest part of writing this sys-call.
• The kernel cannot trust anything it is given by a user-level
application. Each pointer, for example, could be: a) perfectly fine,
b) null, c) outside of the user program's memory space, or d)
pointing to too small an area of memory. Since the kernel can read/
write to any part of memory, it would be disastrous for the kernel
to trust a user-level pointer.
• Each read you do using a pointer passed in as input (a user-level
pointer) should be done via the copy_from_user() macro. This
macro safely copies data from a user-level pointer to a kernel-level
variable: if there's a problem reading or writing the memory, it
stops and returns non-zero without crashing the kernel.
• First use this macro to copy values into a local variables
(which are in the kernel's memory space). Then, use these
local variables in your program. See the Linux Kernel
Development (ch5, p75) for more on the macro.
• Hint: Create a local variable of type long inside your syscall
function. Use copy_from_user() to copy one value at
a time from the user's data array into this variable. If a
copy fails (copy_from_user() returns non-zero) then have
your sys-call end immediately and return -EFAULT.
• Hint: Double check that you only ever access the data
array using copy_from_user()!
• You can directly access size because it is passed by value
so there is no possible problem access memory.
• Likewise, when writing to a user-level pointer, use
copy_to_user() which checks the pointer is valid (non-null),
inside the user-program's memory space, and is writable (vs readonly).
• Hint: Create a local variable of type struct array_stats
inside your sys-call function. Compute the correct values in
this struct first, then at the very end use copy_to_use()
to copy the contents to user's pointer.
• The kernel is compiled with C90; you must declare your variables at the
start of a block (such as your function) vs in the middle of your function.
• A user-space test program is provided to extensively test your system call.
Your sys-call implementation should pass all of these tests. It is likely that
your code will be marked based on passing these (and perhaps other) tests. 
You may want to run the tests one at a time by commenting out calls in
main().
Process Ancestor Sys-Call
• In this section you'll implement a sys-call which returns information about the
current process, plus its ancestors (its parent process, it's grandparent process, and
so on).
Requirements
• In the kernel's cs300/ folder, create a file named process_ancestors.h with
the contents:
// Structure to hold values returned by process_ancestors sys-call
• #ifndef _PROCESS_ANCESTORS_H
• #define _PROCESS_ANCESTORS_H
•
• #define ANCESTOR_NAME_LEN 16
• struct process_info {
• long pid; /* Process ID */
• char name[ANCESTOR_NAME_LEN]; /* Program name of process */
• long state; /* Current process state */
• long uid; /* User ID of process owner */
• long nvcsw; /* # voluntary context switches */
• long nivcsw; /* # involuntary context switches */
• long num_children; /* # children process has */
• long num_siblings; /* # sibling process has */
• };
•
• #endif
• Create a new sys-call named process_ancestors (function
sys_process_ancestors() ):
• Implement it in your kernel's cs300/ folder in a file name
process_ancestors.c. Use
#include "process_ancestors.h"
• Make its sys-call number 332 (in syscall_64.tbl).
• The sys-call's prototype is:
asmlinkage long sys_process_ancestors(
struct process_info info_array[],
long size,
long *num_filled)
• info_array[]: An array of process_info structs that will
be written to by the kernel as it fills in information from the
current process on up through its ancestors.
• size: The number of structs in info_array[]. This is the
maximum number of structs that the kernel will write into
the array (starting with the current process as the first entry
and working up from there). The size may be larger or 
smaller than the actual number of ancestors of the current
process: larger means some entries are left unused (see
num_filled); smaller means information about some
processes not written into the array.
• num_filled: A pointer to a long. To this location the
kernel will store the number of structs (in info_array[])
which are written by the kernel. May be less than size if the
number of ancestors for the current process is less than
size.
• The process_ancestors sys-call must:
• Starting at the current process, fill the elements in info_array[]
with the correct values.
• Ordering: the current process's information goes into
info_array[0]; the parent of the current process into
info_array[1]; grandparent into info_array[2]; and so
on.
• Extra structs in info_array[] are left unmodified.
• Return 0 when successful.
• Returns -EINVAL if size <= 0.
• Returns -EFAULT if any problems access info_array or num_filled.
• You must not allocate or use a large amount of kernel memory to
copy/store large arrays into.
• You must also create a user-space test program which calls your sys-call
and exercises its functionality. You must do at least some testing on to
show it works correctly, and that it generates correct error values in at least
a few of the failure conditions (bad pointers, ...).
• Hint: Use asserts in your test code.
• We will have an extensive test suit to exercise your solution!
Hints
• You will make extensive use of the kernel's task_struct structures: each
process has a task_struct. You can find the task_struct for the current
process using the macro current.
• For example, the PID for the currently running process on this
CPU can be found with:
long pid = current->pid;
• Basic algorithm sketch:
1) Start from current process and fill in fields for info_array[0].
2) Move to parent of this process (current->parent), and copy its info
into info_array[1].
3) Repeat until the parent of the process you are working on is itself 
(cur_task->parent == cur_task).
• The first task spawned by Linux is its own parent, so hence its
parent pointer points to itself. This process has PID 0 and is the
idle task (named swapper).
• I recommend that you first get the info on the current process and
print it to the screen (printk) to ensure you have the correct
values. Then work on getting the data into the process_info
structs and handling ancestors.
• Hints on the fields of process_info:
• Quite a few of the values can be pulled directly out of the
task_struct structure. Look for fields with a matching name.
• task_struct is defined in include/linux/sched.h (in
your kernel folder). To include this in your sys-call
implementation use: #include <linux/sched.h>
• Here is a good online site to navigate the kernel source.
• The name of the program for a process is stored in the
task_struct.comm field.
• The user ID for the owner of a process can be found inside the
process's credentials (cred field). Inside cred, you want to look at
the uid field.
• For counting the number of children and siblings, you'll want to
start with the following linked list nodes: task_struct.children,
and task_struct.sibling.
• These are nodes in circular linked lists. Linux uses the
struct list_head for a node because in a circular linked
list, each node can be thought of as the head of the list.
• You can follow the next field of a node in the list (a
list_head) to get the node (list_head) of the next element in
the list.
• It is a circular linked list, so you'll have to determine how
to count the number of elements (think of how you know
when to stop following next pointers). Hint: Think of
addresses.
• Note that Linux has some clever (complicated) ways of
taking a node in the list (which just has a next and prev
field pointing to other list_head structures) and accessing
the full structure that contains the node. For example, given
a list_head struct that is in a task_struct, the kernel
includes macros to give you the full task_struct!
However, you have (mercifully) been spared having to do
this. If you are interested, for fun try printing out the PID of 
each of the sibling processes.
• Safe memory access is critical. Apply all the suggestions from the
previous sys-call for safe memory access.
• You can use the ps command in your QEMU virtual machine to display
information on running processes and verify the sys-call output. See ps's
man page for how to select the information it displays.
