Array Statistics Sys-Call

• First, you'll add a new system call that computes some basic statistics on an array of data. In practice it makes little sense to have this as a sys-call, but it allows us to become familiar with accessing memory between user and kernel space before accessing other kernel data structures.

• The kernel cannot trust anything it is given by a user-level
application. A user-level pointer could be in one of the following states.
a) perfectly fine,
b) null, 
c) outside of the user program's memory space, 
or d)pointing to too small an area of memory. 
Since the kernel can read and write to any part of memory, it would be disastrous for the kernel to trust a user-level pointer.

• Each read performed on a user-level pointer passed in as input should be done via the copy_from_user() macro. This
macro safely copies data from a user-level pointer to a kernel-level
variable. If there is a problem reading or writing the memory, the macrio stops and returns non-zero without crashing the kernel.

The array_stats sys-call must achieve the followings.
• Set the three fields of the stats structure based on the data array.
The values in data are signed (positive or negative). Nothing special need be done if the sum of all the data overflows or underflows a long.
• Return 0 when successful.
• Returns -EINVAL if size <= 0.
• Returns -EFAULT if any problems access stats or data occur.
• You must not allocate or use a large amount
